# Burglar-Alarm
In this project, I have created a program for an IOT controlled burglar alarm which sends automatic **SMS** and **E-MAIL** to the user in case of a burglar attack. In the future, a hardware implementation of the project would be made.
I have used [pyzmail](http://www.magiksys.net/pyzmail/), a python library for sending emails and [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/sms) for sending text messages. I would be using Raspberry Pi as the primary server for this project.
